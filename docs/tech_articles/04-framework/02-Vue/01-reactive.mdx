## Create a Vue3 project
1. Run the code below in the terminal:
```powershell
npm create vue@latest
```
2. `cd` into the project path, run the instruction below:
```powershell
npm install
```
3. Type `npm run dev`, you can now see the vue3 website run on the browser.

## Syntax
Vue3 has the powerful syntax - composition api, it's very different with the options api of Vue2, but you still can write options api in Vue3 (not recommend).

```xml title='composition api'
<script setup>
  <!-- put all your methods and variables here -->
</script>

<template>
  <!-- the HTML structure -->
</template>

<style scoped>
 <!-- css style, use `scope` let the css command only work in this component ​ -->
</style>
```

### Text Interpolation
In the template, if there have a variable you want to render, use `{{...}}`, like below:
```xml
<span>Message: {{ msg }}</span>
```

### Raw HTML
If your variable contains HTML content, you should not use `{{...}}` since it will treat the variable's content as plain text.  
Instead, you should use the `v-html` directive to insert HTML content：
```xml
<!-- rawHtml = <span style="color: red">This should be red.</span> -->
<p>Using v-html directive: <span v-html="rawHtml"></span></p>
```

### Attribute Bindings
If you want to binding a variable on the attribute, use `v-bind`. For example:
```xml
<h1 v-bind:class="{addColor: changed}">I will change my color</h1>
```
Here means: when changed is `true`, this `<h1>` will add a class name `addColor`.  
You can use a shorthand for `v-bind` as shown below:
```xml
<h1 :class="{addColor: changed}">I will change my color</h1>
```

:::info
There are many directives in Vue. For example:  
1. `v-for`:  This is a loop used to create multiple elements.
2. `v-if` or `v-show`: These are used to conditionally display elements.
3. `v-on`:  This is used to bind an event handler.

## Reactivity Fundamentals
Reactivity is a crucial concept in Vue.  
We use `useState` to manage reactive data in React. However, in Vue3, it use `ref`, `reactive` and `computed` for this purpose.

### ref
It can store any type of data.  
However, when storing objects or arrays that require reactive properties, reactive is often preferred.

Note that when accessing the value of a ref in `<script setup>`, you should append .value to it.  
However, in `<template>`, you can directly use `{{ref}}` to access the value without .value.
```xml
<script setup>
  import { ref } from 'vue';
  const num = ref(0)
  const changeNum = () => num.value += 1
</script>

<template>
  <h1>{{ num }}</h1>
  {/* these two lines of code do the same thing */}
  <button @click="changeNum">Add one</button>
  <button @click="num++">Add one</button>
</template>
```

:::warning
Please use `const` to declare a `ref`. Do not use `let` or `var`!
:::

### reactive
When accessing properties of a reactive object, unlike with `ref`, there's no need to append `.value`.
```xml
<script setup>
  import { reactive } from 'vue';
  const people2 = reactive({
    name: 'Jeremy',
    gender: 'Male',
    age: 20
  })

  const changePeople2 = () => {
    people2.name = 'Lucy'
    console.log('people2 changed')
  }
</script>

<template>
  <h1>{{ people2.name }} / {{ people2.gender }}</h1>
  <button @click="changePeople2">Change!</button>
</template>
```
:::info
### Difference between `ref` and `reactive`
Not just if you need to append `.value` or not.  
When a `ref` is used to store an object, deep changes within the object's properties might not be detected by `watch`, as ref is primarily designed to track direct assignments to its value.  
In contrast, an object made reactive with `reactive` can more effectively track changes to its internal properties.

But, if you add the third parameter `deep: true` when using `watch` to observe a `ref` object, `watch` will be able to detect changes within the properties of the `ref` object. This is because adding `deep: true` enables `watch` to perform deep observation.

```xml
watch(people1, () => {
  console.log('something changed')
}, {deep : true})
```
:::

### computed
In Vue, `computed` is a method used to define reactive properties that can be computed.  
Computed properties automatically recalculate their value when the data they depend on changes.  
This is particularly useful for complex logic that needs to update automatically based on certain data.
```xml title='Before use computed'
<script setup>
  import { ref } from 'vue';
  const num1 = ref(1)
  const num2 = ref(2)
</script>

<template>
  <h1>Num1: {{ num1 }}</h1>
  <h1>Num2: {{ num2 }}</h1>
  <h1>Num1 + Num2 = {{ num1 + num2 }}</h1>
</template>
```

```xml title='After use computed'
<script setup>
  import { ref, computed } from 'vue';
  const num1 = ref(1)
  const num2 = ref(2)

  const numPlus = computed(()=>{
    return num1.value  + num2.value
  })
</script>

<template>
  <h1>Num1: {{ num1 }}</h1>
  <h1>Num2: {{ num2 }}</h1>
  <h1>Num1 + Num2 = {{ numPlus }}</h1>
</template>
```
You can see after we use `computed`, we put all the logic into `<script setup>`.

:::info
### Difference between method and computed
1. `computed` only works when the reactive data changes.
2. You cannot pass any parameters to `computed`.
3. By default, `computed` only has a `getter`.
